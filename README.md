
# Introduction
This project is an implementation of a Spring Boot + MyBatis-Plus + MySQL technology stack for a front-end and back-end separated online food delivery management system, referencing the tutorial "Riji Takeout" from Bilibili's Black Horse Programmer. In this project, my responsibilities include the development of the back-end code and conducting unit tests.
# Project Access
> If you want to run this program, I strongly recommend using v1.0, as the current version is delpyed on a server automatically, you cannot access it using your own machine.

> After the project is running, access the following address. Replace the IP address with your own, if it's local, use 'localhost', and the port is the one you've set, typically defaulting to 8080.

Frontend: /front/page/login.html

Backend: /backend/page/login/login.html

> If you use local address, then you should access the following address

Frontend: [http://localhost:8080/front/page/login.html](http://localhost:8080/front/page/login.html)

Backend: [http://localhost:8080/backend/page/login/login.html](http://localhost:8080/backend/page/login/login.html)
